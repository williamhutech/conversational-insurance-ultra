## 6. Our rights  


At any time after an event has happened giving rise to a claim or series of claims under the personal liability section of this policy, we may pay you the full amount of the claim (or any smaller amount we can settle the claim for) and then will have no responsibility for dealing with any claim, defence or proceedings. We will not be responsible for any damage, loss or liability alleged to have been caused to you or the insured person as a result of any alleged act or failure to act on our part in connection with that claim, defence or proceedings. We will not be legally responsible for any costs or expenses you or any person claiming may have expended after our liability has been released.

## 8. Time limit for taking legal action  


If you do not begin legal action within 12 months after the arbitration award is made, we will not be legally responsible for the claim.  


## 9. False or exaggerated claims
