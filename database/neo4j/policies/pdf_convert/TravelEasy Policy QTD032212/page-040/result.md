# SECTION 42 - GOLFER'S COVER


# Golfing equipment


We will pay the **adult insured person** for loss or damage to the golfing equipment (golf clubs and bags) belonging to or on loan to the **adult insured person** due to accident or theft during the **journey** overseas but not for any loss or damage suffered during the course of play or practice.


We may choose to pay the claim or repair any damaged item after taking into account wear and tear and market value. We may not consider any loss in market value for golfing equipment bought within one year before the date of accident if the **adult insured person** can produce evidence (for example, original receipts). If any item is proven to be beyond economical repair, we will deal with the claim under this section as if the item had been lost.


# Green fees


We will pay for overseas pre-booked green fees which are not refundable if the **adult insured person** cannot play on the scheduled booked dates due to **injury** or **illness** suffered after booking and payment has been made.
