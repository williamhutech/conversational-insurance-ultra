the scheduled departure time given by the carrier in the original itinerary to the actual scheduled departure time of the replacement flight. For connecting flights, the period of delay for each flight are calculated separately and are not added together.  


## 2. Alternative Travel Arrangement  


If the insured person is able to book an alternative transportation to the same destination that departs earlier than the next available scheduled departure time offered by the same provider of the public transport which was delayed, we will pay for the additional administrative or/and travel expenses incurred. The maximum we will reimburse under (b) Alternative travel arrangement shall not exceed the amount we would have paid if the insured person had claimed under (a) Delay benefit, calculated from the original scheduled departure time to the next available scheduled departure time offered by the same public transport provider, less any refund recovered.  


To qualify for claim under this section, the insured person must have checked- in in line with the original itinerary and received written confirmation from the carrier or their handling agents stating the reason and length of delay.  


The maximum we will pay under this section is:  



<table><tr><td>Premier Plan</td><td>$1,500 for each insured person<br>$3,000 in total for adult and children cover or family cover</td></tr><tr><td>Elite Plan</td><td>$1,000 for each insured person<br>$2,000 in total for adult and children cover or family cover</td></tr><tr><td>Standard Plan</td><td>$500 for each insured person<br>$1,000 in total for adult and children cover or family cover</td></tr></table>  


If a claim under section 25 - Delayed departure, section 26 - Flight diversion, section 27 - Overbooked flight, section 28 - Missed travel connection, section 29 - Shortening the trip, section 30 - Travel disruption and section 50 - Hijack of public transport, results from the same event, we will pay for the claim under one of the sections only.  


## What is not covered  


Please see the section on exclusions.  


## SECTION 26 - FLIGHT DIVERSION  


We will pay \(100 for every full six hours in a row of delay if, while travelling on a scheduled flight, the insured person's flight is diverted due to:  


1. poor weather conditions;  


2. natural disasters;  


3. emergency medical treatment for a fellow passenger; or  


4. the mechanical breakdown of the aircraft;  


and this prevents the insured person from continuing their journey and they are delayed from arriving at their planned destination.  


The insured person must get written confirmation from the carrier, operator or handling agent stating the reasons and length of delay.  


The period of delay is calculated from the scheduled arrival time at the planned destination given by the carrier in the original itinerary to the actual arrival time of the insured person's flight.
