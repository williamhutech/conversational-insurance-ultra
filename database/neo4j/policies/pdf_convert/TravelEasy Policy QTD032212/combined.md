This policy is only valid if:  


1. For the risk insured, you have never had any insurance stopped in the last 12 months due to breaking any premium-payment condition; or2. you have declared that you have broken any premium-payment for a previous policy taken up with another insurer in the last 12 months.  


You must have fully paid all outstanding premiums to the previous insurer based on the short period rate for the previous policy and we must have a copy of written confirmation from the previous insurer to prove this before our cover starts.  


## Premium payment warranty - This applies if you are a business

2. If the above doesn't happen:  


a) the cover under the policy, renewal certificate or cover note will automatically end after the 60-day period; 
b) this will not affect the coverage under the policy within the 60-day period; and 
c) we will be entitled to the premium for the time we provided cover subject to a minimum of \(\) 50\$
