6. The travel companion is denied boarding of the public transport by the local authority or transport provider on the scheduled departure date due to COVID-19 symptoms and thereafter tested positive for COVID-19 by a doctor or government approved personnel within 5 days from scheduled departure date.  


To avoid any doubt,  


1. we will assess the claim based on the date which the COVID-19 test was done and not the date which the test results are released. Claims due to COVID-19 infection diagnosed from test done after the \(90^{\text{th}}\) day from the start of the trip are not covered.  


2. section 30 covers for any additional travel expenses incurred by the insured person related to making changes to the original scheduled journey. For claims relating to unexpected quarantine or isolation during the trip, refer to "Overseas quarantine daily benefit" benefit under COVID-19 Cover.  


If a claim under section 29 (Shortening the trip) or section 30 (Travel disruption) results from the same event, we will pay for the claim under one of the sections only.  


## Section 31 - Automatic extension of cover  


If insured person's homeward journey cannot be completed before the end date shown in the policy, cover will stay in force due to any of these covered reasons below without additional premium for an insured person for up to:  


1. 30 days if the insured person is hospitalised due to COVID-19 infection.  


2. 14 days if the insured person is  


a) tested positive for COVID-19 by a doctor or government approved personnel; or 
b) specifically identified and ordered by the local government at the overseas destination to undergo quarantine or isolation due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.  


This section will operate only if any of the covered reasons above occurs within 90 days from the start of the trip.  


If 48 hours after discharge from hospital, quarantine or isolation, the insured person is unable to return to Singapore, further extension of the period of insurance will require top-up of premium, unless MSIG Assist has assessed the insured person to be unfit for travel back to Singapore. Please refer to section 15 for contact details of MSIG Assist.  


## Overseas quarantine daily benefit  


We will pay the daily benefit for each complete 24-hour period of quarantine or isolation up to the sum insured specified under the COVID- 19 Cover benefit summary if the insured person is tested positive for COVID- 19 by a doctor or government approved personnel within the first 90 days of the trip and ordered to undergo quarantine or isolation at a government approved hotel or COVID- 19 medical facility outside Singapore.  


This benefit is payable provided the insured person is liable to pay for the charges incurred at the government approved hotel or COVID- 19 medical facility. Government approved hotel refers to hotel approved by the government for the purpose of COVID- 19 quarantine or any hotel which you are residing in if permitted by the local government.  


To avoid any doubt, we will assess the claim based on the date which the COVID- 19 test was done and not the date which the test results are released. Claims due to COVID- 19 infection diagnosed from test done after the 90th day from the start of the trip are not covered.
