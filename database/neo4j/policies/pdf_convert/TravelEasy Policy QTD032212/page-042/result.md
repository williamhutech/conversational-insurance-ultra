# SECTION 44 - RENTAL VEHICLE EXCESS


We will pay the excess if the **adult insured person** legally has to pay this amount if during a **journey** outside Singapore, an **adult insured person** rents or hires a car, or a campervan:


1. from a licensed rental agency; and


2. the rental agreement includes an excess (or deductible or similar condition) which makes the **adult insured person** legally responsible for loss or damage to the rental vehicle.


This applies as long as it is as a result of accidental loss or damage to the vehicle and:


1. the **adult insured person** must be either a named driver or co-driver of the rental vehicle;


2. the **adult insured person** has kept to all requirements of the rental agreement;


3. at the time of the accident, the **adult insured person** was licensed to drive the vehicle and was not taking part in or practicing for speed or time trials of any kind, or driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs or any drugs abuse;


4. as part of the hiring arrangement, the **adult insured person** must take up a full motor insurance against loss or damage to the rental vehicle during the rental period; and


5. the driver must be one of the **insured persons** of this policy at the time of the **accident.**


The maximum we will pay under this section is:

To avoid any doubt,


1. we will only pay limit for one **adult insured person** per rented vehicle, regardless of the number of **insured persons** registered to rent the vehicle or the number of **insured persons** authorised to drive the rented vehicle.


2. the limit for one **adult insured person** is for the entire **trip** regardless of the number of vehicles the **insured person** rents during the **trip.**
